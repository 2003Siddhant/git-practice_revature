git has
1) working directory: where we can save , edit or add new files
2) staging area : wher git tracks the files and are ready to be commited. only this files will be commited.
3) repository : here files that are commited will be saved and can be used whenever required.

 1) untracked files: here git doesn't track the files and only sees it
2) modified area : git tracks here but not in staging area. files which are been previously commited are changed here.
3) staged area : here files which are needed to be saved in a repo are present.
4) commited area : here the files are saved and can be used whenever required.

Git commit : it stores the snapshot of the changes , a checkpoint is created. working directory becomes clean.

git amend: used to change commit which has some mistakes. can only be done in local repo .

git ignore :  tells git to not track this files. ex: when we import express , we dont need to keep the track of all the libraries it has imported. so we tell them to be inside git ignore.

imp: to change the branch from master to main -> git branch -m master main
--> if main already exist then : git checkout main -> git switch main

BRANCHING: git has a default main branch where head points to it.
Creates a new branch and doesn't switch to it and we remain on the current batch. 
ex: git branch feature-login

switching the branch : git checkout feature-login : it basically moves our head pointer and updates the working directory.

git checkout -b absdkjaf: it instantly creates new branch and switches the head 
git switch: its good for beginners, used only for branches
ex: git switch -c abcd

DELETION: deletes a local branch -> ex: git branch -d abcd
-> allows deletion only if branch has been merged and no data lost.

RENAME: for curr branch : git branch -m new-name
for another branch: git branch -m old-name new-name --> just useful in naming conventions.

imp: suppose we made a commit and the commit becomes fault. so in this case we cna remove it by making our head pointer change to the previous commit id. this can be done in 2 ways.
a) git reset --hard "abc"
b) git revert "abc" : its a more efficient way and no data loss.

MERGING : process of combining changes from one branch into another. basically used to merge branches.
1. fast forward merge: target branch has no new commits. git can simply move the branch pointer forward. no merge commit is created.
--> before merging switch into the branch where you want to merge into and then merge it using 
ex: git merge branch
